# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive Italian translation for the entire React application UI. The goal is to translate all user-facing text elements while maintaining the existing application structure, functionality, and user experience. The implementation will use a modern internationalization (i18n) approach that allows for easy maintenance and potential future language additions.

2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN all page titles, headings, and navigation elements SHALL be in Italian
3. WHEN interacting with forms THEN all labels, placeholders, and validation messages SHALL be in Italian
4. WHEN viewing dialogs and modals THEN all dialog content and action buttons SHALL be in Italian

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent Italian translations across all components, so that the application feels professionally localized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing UI components THEN all button text SHALL use consistent Italian terminology
2. WHEN reading form labels THEN terminology SHALL be consistent across similar fields
